# Cartwheel 3D

Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/cartwheel-3d

I have exported this because Google Code is preparing to shut down.
I intend this to be an archive of the original work as it is,
if I will ever do any modifications, they will be done in a fork.

Cartwheel 3D is a 3D physics-based character animation framework
